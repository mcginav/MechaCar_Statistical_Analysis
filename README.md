# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

After you’ve completed the technical analysis for each deliverable, provide a short summary of the results in the README.md of the analysis.

In the written summaries, we would like you to think critically about your analysis, not demonstrate mastery of automotive manufacturing.
